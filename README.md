# Alarm Clock

FSM (Finite State Machine) description-


Alarm Clock as a Finite State Machine
I Designed an Alarm Clock using a finite state machine in which there are three states which are as follows-


Alarm(Idle)
Alarm(Ringing)
Alarm(Snoozing)


First of all, we will set the time of the alarm at that fixed time, alarm clock will start ringing then there are two option either to snooze the alarm clock or stop the alarm clock. If we had chosen first option to snooze, then alarm will start ringing after 5 minutes or if chose second option alarm clock will stop ringing i.e., the transition states are- Alarmed,snooze,Alarmed,Stop,
Hence, there are three states and four transition state in our alarm clock
